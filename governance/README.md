# Stay up to date with Azure

We know that staying up to date with Azure can be challenging, but it really should be part of your governance strategy so that you know about new features that may benefit you or upcoming changes that may affect you. Below you can find the top resources that we use ourselves to stay up to date, as well as some additional resources for deeper content.

#### Top Resources

* [Azure Service Health](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/service-health/service-health-overview)
    * You can use this to get timely notifications for ongoing service issues, planned maintenance and health advisories including features being deprecated
* [Azure Updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/)
    * A single place where most updates are posted and that you can subscribe to
    * These are mostly just very short announcements with a link to details, so this is quite easy to follow
    * Subscribe via [RSS](https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/en-us/updates/feed/)
* [Azure Blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/)
    * This blog contains the most important announcements for the Azure platform, so by following this you will also get the most critical information
    * Subscribe via [RSS](https://azurecomcdn.azureedge.net/en-us/blog/feed/)
* Service specific blogs
    * Usually there are also specific blogs for individual Azure services as well that are good to follow if you heavily rely on them
    * There are of course too many to list here, but you can easily find them through a web search
* [Azure Info Hub](http://aka.ms/azureinfohub)
    * This is an unofficial resource but contains an aggregation of most of the resources above and you can go into details for individual services (also making it a great way to discover those service-specific blogs for example)
    * Subscribe via [RSS](http://azureinfohub.azurewebsites.net/Feed?serviceTitle=Azure)

#### Additional Resources

* [Azure Friday](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Friday)

* [Azure Weekly Newsletter](http://azureweekly.info/)
    * This is an unofficial resource provided by [endjin](https://endjin.com/) which is a summary of the week's top news in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem, as well as interesting historic content that's well worth reading
